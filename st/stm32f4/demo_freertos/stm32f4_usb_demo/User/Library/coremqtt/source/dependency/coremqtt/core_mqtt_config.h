/**
 * @brief The maximum number of MQTT PUBLISH messages that may be pending
 * acknowledgment at any time.
 *
 * QoS 1 and 2 MQTT PUBLISHes require acknowledgment from the server before
 * they can be completed. While they are awaiting the acknowledgment, the
 * client must maintain information about their state. The value of this
 * macro sets the limit on how many simultaneous PUBLISH states an MQTT
 * context maintains.
